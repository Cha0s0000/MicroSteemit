## Considering the fact that there are a lot of Asians as steemians and they widely use wechat especially the Chinese, Microsteemit was created

* Microsteemit is an opensource interface on the steemit blockchain. It is is an application based on wechat which is an interface with the steemit
community.  Wechat is a social media application just like facebook which you can connect with friends while microsteemit is like esteem. It was 
built by @cha0s0000. We used the idea of a widely used application which is whatsapp and he created a steemit interface on it

* We thought of a way to make steemit more convinient for users especially the Chinese as they use wechat a lot so we created Microsteemit.

* Microsteemit can be used by scanning a QR code from Wechat
